# https://mellowdev77.github.io/static_site_generator/

A website generator that takes markdown files and turns them into pure HTML.

To get started add your markdown files to the "content" folder. Then you can add additional images and .css styles on the "static" folder.

In your markdown you can reference these images like this:

     ![image description] (/images/your_image.png)

The styling is automatically added to the website.
